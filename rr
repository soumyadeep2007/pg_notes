GDB notes:

* x/4096xb <pointer> -> will print 4096 bytes in hex format starting from pointer.

Example:

...
0x7ff21bdd9650: 0x0d    0xff    0xff    0xf4    0x0f    0x5c    0x91    0xff
0x7ff21bdd9658: 0xff    0xff    0x6d    0x40    0x08    0x10    0x22    0x6a
...

* Dump memory:
dump memory <to_file_name> start_pointer end_pointer

* Restore:


RR notes:

* rr record

* rr replay -f <pid>

* rr replay -M ... puts in helpful pid information with each stdout line.

* TMP_DIR env variable to specify a tmp dir for RR to make temp files.
	rr does a lot of copies, we observed this when we were replaying two concurrent COPY sessions.

* checkpoint # creates a checkpoint

* restart <checkpoint#> -> will go upto checkpoint
	-- Jumping b/w checkpoints is pretty fast as compared to replay

* rr has event numbers corresponding to where we are in the recording.
	-- "when" will give you the event#.
	-- an event # is generated for things like syscalls, signals etc.
	-- It is possible to replay upto a specific event #
		rr replay .. -g <event#>
		This will replay upto the event# and then attach the debugger.
	-- It may be worthwhile trying to replay
